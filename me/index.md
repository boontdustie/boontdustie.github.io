My name is Garrett Kelly.
I am the co-founder of the online/Low Power FM (LPFM) radio station [Hollow Earth Radio](http://www.hollowearthradio.org).
I maintain a faux street fashion blog: [Sequins In Seattle](http://sequinsinseattle.com).
I play drums in a band called [Clearinghouse](http://shrillwave.com) w/ Smitty from Mr. Epp & the Calculations, Eric Ostrowski from Noggin, and Brittnie Fuller from kombucha brewing fame.
I like to hear about your paranormal encounters.
